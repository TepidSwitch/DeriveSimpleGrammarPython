# DeriveSimpleGrammarPython

Given a grammer with spaces in between each unit and a maximum output length, 
this script spits out every possible terminal combination up to that length.
Nothing fancy, I found it to be an interesting exercise though.

Improvements: work out why that algorithm has so many repeats so I can remove the 
primitive check for repeats list.
